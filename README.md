## About The Project

StockFinder is a project aimed at investors who prefer a straightforward and interactive approach to stock management and discovery. It's built to streamline the process of creating a personalized watchlist with an easy-to-use interface that responds to the user's investment preferences.

Utilizing real-time financial data from Finnhub and yFinance, StockFinder keeps users informed with the latest stock updates. The robust backend, built on Java Spring and supported by a Postgres database, ensures efficient data management.
